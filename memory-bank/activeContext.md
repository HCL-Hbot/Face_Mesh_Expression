# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Documenting all code components in README.md
- Configuration and data loading pipeline documentation completed
- Proceeding with documentation of remaining pipeline components

## Recent Changes
- Added detailed configuration documentation to README.md
- Documented data loading pipeline and workflow
- Established directory structure documentation

## Next Steps
1. Document model training implementation (model_train.py)
2. Document hyperparameter tuning system (hp_model_tuner.py)
3. Document training callbacks and monitoring (training_callbacks.py)
4. Document TensorBoard integration (tensorboard_utils.py)
5. Document image preparation utilities (imagePrep.py)
6. Document file handling utilities (fileHandler.py)
7. Document main pipeline execution (main.py, main2.py)

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Documentation structure follows component-based organization
- Each component documentation includes:
  - Overview and purpose
  - Key features and functionality
  - Configuration options
  - Usage examples
  - Integration points
- Maintaining consistency between code and documentation
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage of all features
- Integrating documentation with existing project structure

## Implementation Status
- Configuration system fully documented
- Data loading pipeline documented with workflow and features
- Remaining components pending documentation
- Need to validate documentation against current implementation

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring documentation completeness
- Maintaining consistency across components
- Balancing detail with clarity
- Covering integration points between components
