# Project Progress

## Current Status
The FaceMesh Pipeline project is in active development with core components established and initial implementation underway.

## Completed Features
- Project structure and configuration setup
- MediaPipe FaceMesh integration
- Basic data processing pipeline
- TensorFlow model training framework
- Logging and versioning system

## In Progress
- Hyperparameter tuning implementation
- Model evaluation metrics
- TensorBoard integration
- Comprehensive testing framework

## Next Steps
1. Complete hyperparameter tuning implementation
2. Finalize model evaluation metrics
3. Implement comprehensive testing
4. Optimize data processing pipeline
5. Document API usage and examples

## Known Issues
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
- Need to implement model export functionality
- Documentation needs expansion
- Testing coverage needs improvement

## Milestones
- [x] Project setup and configuration
- [x] Core pipeline implementation
- [ ] Model training and evaluation
