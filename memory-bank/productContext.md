# Product Context: FaceMesh Pipeline

## Overview
The FaceMesh Pipeline is a comprehensive system for facial expression recognition, leveraging MediaPipe's FaceMesh solution for accurate facial landmark detection and TensorFlow for machine learning model training and evaluation.

## Key Components
1. **Data Processing**
   - Handles JPG, PNG, JPEG formats
   - Outlier detection using Isolation Forest
   - Removal of zero-value landmarks
   - Filtering for specific facial features (eyes, mouth)
   - Conversion to TensorFlow Dataset format
   - One-hot encoding of labels

2. **Model Training**
   - TensorFlow-based model architecture
   - Hyperparameter tuning with 1000 max trials
   - Comprehensive logging and versioning
   - TensorBoard integration for visualization
   - 20% validation split for model evaluation

3. **System Configuration**
   - Centralized configuration in pipeline/config.py
   - Input image size: 240x320
   - Model input shape: 216 features
   - Batch size: 8
   - Epochs: 50
   - Face Mesh detection confidence: 0.5
   - Face Mesh tracking confidence: 0.5
